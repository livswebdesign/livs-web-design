<h1>How to organize travel with Notion</h1>
	<p>If you haven’t heard of notion before I suggest you go to their website and download this powerhouse of an app. Notion is a web-based application that many people in tech, project managers, students and creatives use to organize projects, assignments, budget, or life in general. I use my notion for everything from my personal budget to vacations, my social media job, journaling, and mood boarding and habit tracker. This app is extremely easy to use and my holy grail. You can make your own templates, use a pre done template, or buy templates others have made on Etsy. Depending on what I need a page for, I’ll either select from a template that’s available or make my own. Planning and organizing a vacation can be a daunting task, but with the help of Notion and their templates, you can break it down into manageable pieces. Start by listing all the bills that need to be paid before the trip. This could include things like travel expenses, lodging, or car rental. Once you have a list of all the expenses, it's time to create a list of all the things you need to buy or pay for. This could include things like food, souvenirs, and other items you may need for the duration of your trip. Next, create a list of things to pay for with your next paycheck. This could include any additional items you may need for the trip, such as clothes, souvenirs, or items for activities. Additionally, make sure to include a list of any debts that need to be paid before the trip. This will ensure that you are able to pay for everything once you arrive. Finally, make a list of hotel confirmation numbers, flight info, emergency contacts and a packing list based off the average temperature of your stay. By breaking the task of organizing a vacation into smaller, more manageable sections, Notion can help you save time and make sure you don't forget anything. With the help of Notion, you will be able to have a stress-free and organized vacation.</p>
