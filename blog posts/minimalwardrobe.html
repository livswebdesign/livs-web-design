	<h1>building a wardrobe that works for you</h1>
<p> With social media and influencer culture being at an all-time high, it’s extremely difficult to stay away from what’s popular and find your own path. Me, being extremely easily influenced a lot of the things I do ( what I use to clean, what style of pants I wear, the food I make) are pretty much all influenced from social media or my best friends (my own personal influencers). Something I tried to do to get away from this was to decorate my house and myself with a neutral style. I figured if everything I have is neutral, I’ll be less susceptible to following a trend and will spend less money. While getting dressed is a lot easier, it’s not necessarily fun. However, as spring is now upon us (yay equinox!) I have just gone ahead and decluttered my closet space to create a more minimalist wardrobe. while the whole idea of minimalism (at least in my case) came from a trend, it’s helpful for me because I’m neurodivergent. It takes the stress out of getting dressed in the morning and can help me focus on the things that are more important. In this blog post, I’m going to discuss some tips and tricks for creating a minimalist wardrobe that works for you.<br>
<br>
	<h2>Assess your current wardrobe</h2>
Before you can create a minimalist wardrobe, you need to assess what you currently have. Do your laundry and take everything out of your closet and lay it on your bed. Go through each item and decide if it brings you joy or if it's something you wear often. If it doesn't fit into either category, it's time to Marie Kondo it!<br>
	<br> 
	<h2>Choose a color palette</h2>
Choose a color palette for your wardrobe that makes sense for your lifestyle. If you work in a professional environment, you may want to stick with neutral colors like black, white, and grey. If you're a creative person, you may want to incorporate some brighter colors into your wardrobe. Personally, I kind of mix the two but I make sure to have basics because if you have too many eclectic pieces, you’ll have nothing to wear but if it’s too neutral it’s like wearing a uniform.<br>
	<br>
	<h2>Invest in quality pieces</h2>
	When creating a minimalist wardrobe, it's important to invest in quality pieces that will last a long time. This may mean spending a bit more money upfront, but it will save you money in the long run. Look for items made from high-quality materials and that are well-constructed.<br>
	<br>
	<h2>Stick with versatile pieces</h2>
	Choose versatile pieces that can be worn in a variety of ways. For example, a classic white button-up shirt can be dressed up for work or dressed down for a casual weekend look. This will help you get more use out of each item in your wardrobe.<br>
	<br>
	<h2>Get rid of anything you havent worn in a year</h2>
	If you haven't worn something in a year, it's time to let it go. Donate it to a local thrift store or sell it online. This will free up space in your closet for the items you wear.
Creating a minimalist wardrobe, even though it may be a daunting task, can be a rewarding experience. By assessing your current wardrobe, choosing a color palette, investing in quality pieces, sticking with versatile pieces, and getting rid of anything you haven't worn in a year, you can create a wardrobe that works for you.
