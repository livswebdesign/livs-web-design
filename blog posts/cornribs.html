	<p>I love food (as most people do) and during covid when everyone was stuck at home people were getting pretty creative with their food. Me, being naturally curious, I wanted to try every single thing which led to a ton of grocery credit card debt and also a lot of new favorite recipes. Today, Im sharing one of my favorites. I hope you love it as much as I do.<br> </p>
	<h2> Ingredients:</h2><br>
	<li> 4 corn on the cobs (sliced in quarters)</li>
	<li> 4 tbsp vegan butter/ regular butter or olive oil</li>
	<li> 1 tsp lemon pepper</li>
	<li> 1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
	<li> 1/2 tsp chili powder</li>
	<li> 1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
	<li> 1/2 tsp paprika</li>
	<li> pinch of salt</li>
	<li> cilantro</li>
	<li> feta cheese or cotija cheese</li>
	<h2>For the sauce:</h2><br>
	<li> 1/2 cup of mayo</li>
	<li> 1 tsp chopped chipotle in adobo sauce</li>
	<li> â€¢1/2 a lime (for the juice)</li>
	
<h2> Instructions: </h2>
	<ol>
	<li>Cut cobs in half long ways and then in half again so theres 4 long thin pieces. repeat until finished.</li>
	<li>Mix together your oil/butter and spices and brush it on the cobs</li>
	<li>Cook for 10 minutes @ 400 degrees in the air fryer flipping halfway (do not stack the cobs just do multiple rounds so everything cooks evenly. I did 4 rounds since i had 4 cobs)</li>
	<li>Mix together mayo, lime juice and chopped chipotle in a bowl and set aside</li>
	<li>Once the cobs are done you can either drizzle the dressing over them or use it as a dip (I drizzled mine)</li>
	<li>Top with cilantro and cotija and serve immediately.</li>
	</ol>
