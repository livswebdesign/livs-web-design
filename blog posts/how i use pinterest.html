	<h1>How I use pinterest to manifest my dream life</h1>
<p> I'm a big believer in the power of visualization and intention setting. I use Pinterest to create vision boards for different goals/ visualizing life. I make a point of looking at these boards every day, even if just for a few minutes and add at least a few pins to each board. Doing this  helps keep me focused and accountable  and gives me the motivation I need to take action toward achieving my goals.<br>
<br>
I’ve found the more that I focus on something and believe it to be true before it is, the more things fall into place and work out in my favor. I’m not sure if thats just because I’m constantly thinking about how the little actions I make daily affect the life I want to have or  maybe it's just that paying close attention to our goals makes us more aware of opportunities to pursue them. Either way, using Pinterest and vision boards to visualize what I want has been a simple yet powerful practice for me. I've manifested some big goals and dreams this way, and I know that staying focused on what I truly desire will lead to continued growth.<br>
	<br>
If you don't already have a practice for visualizing your goals and dreams, I highly recommend trying this. Having a Pinterest board can be really effective for keeping you on track toward your goals or keeping you creative by trying a new recipe or DIY project.</p>
